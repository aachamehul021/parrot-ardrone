# parrot-ardrone

A project to try to run a Parrot AR Drone autonomously from an external computational device.

This should ideally work on both the ARDrone 1 and 2

Although both these drones are very old (2012), they might still provide a good platform to test advanced navigation algorithms. In addition, previous projects conducted on the ARDrone in the realm of autonomous navigation might give a good starting point to controlling the drone, although these projects too are very old and work on obselete software.

Ideal steps for progressing on the project:
1. Setup a working environment with ROS and Gazebo simulation
2. Perform autnomous navigation using the ROS interface
3. Implement SLAM/State estimation
4. Implement advanced control stratergies
